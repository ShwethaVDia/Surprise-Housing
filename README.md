## General Information
- The company wants to know which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house
- How well those variables describe the price of a house
- Determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression
- This model will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary 
with the variables.
- The model will be a good way for management to userstand the pricing dynamics of a new market
- To build the model company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file.
